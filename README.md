# Skin-cancer-using-U-Net-CNN
A lightweight U-Net model designed for skin lesion segmentation using the ISIC 2018 dataset. It follows an encoder–decoder architecture with skip connections, processing 128×128 RGB images to produce binary masks. Trained with binary cross-entropy and Adam optimizer, it’s fast, efficient, and suitable for medical image analysis.
